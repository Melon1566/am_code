# Install T3 Code

T3 Code runs coding agents on your computer and lets you control them from its
desktop, web, or mobile app. Set up the machine where the agents will work first.

## Requirements

Command-line use, SSH hosts, and WSL backends need Node.js 22.16+ (22.x), 23.11+
(23.x), or 24.10 and later. The native desktop app includes its server runtime.

You need an installed, authenticated provider before starting a thread. You can
launch T3 Code and configure providers afterwards.

## Run without installing

```bash
npx t3@latest
```

This starts the server and opens the local web app. Run
`npx t3@latest --help` for command-line options.

## Desktop app

Download a release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code/releases),
or use a package manager:

| Platform           | Install                         |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Windows            | `winget install T3Tools.T3Code` |
| macOS              | `brew install --cask t3-code`   |
| Arch Linux         | `yay -S t3code-bin`             |
| Arch Linux nightly | `yay -S t3code-nightly-bin`     |

### Windows Subsystem for Linux

Choose a WSL distro in **Settings → Connections** to run agents and projects
there. Install Node.js and provider CLIs inside that distro. T3 Code installs its
matching server runtime there automatically; the first launch after an app
update can take longer.

### Open a project from a terminal

With the desktop app already running on the same machine:

```bash
npx t3 app
```

This opens a new thread for the current directory, adding the project if needed.
Pass a path, such as `npx t3 app ../my-project`, to open another directory. It requires
the desktop app, so a standalone server or an SSH session is not enough. If the
command cannot reach the app, start or update the desktop app and try again.

## Mobile app

Install T3 Code from the
[App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/t3-code-remote-claude-more/id6787819824) or
[Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.t3tools.t3code).
The phone connects to a server on another machine. Follow
[remote access](./remote-access.md) to link it through T3 Connect or a pairing URL.

If the app crashes during launch, open Settings → Diagnostics on the next launch
that succeeds. It lists startup crashes from the last 7 days with the error and
component stack that store crash reports leave out. Copy the report and paste it
into a GitHub issue. Error messages can quote values from the app, so read it over
before sharing.

## Providers

Open **Settings → Providers** in the web or desktop app, select the environment,
and enable the provider you want. Installation, login, and configuration belong
to that environment's machine, even when you connect from a phone or another
computer.

| Provider    | Install and authenticate                                                                     |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Codex       | Install [Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli), then run `codex login`.        |
| Claude      | Install [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code), then run `claude auth login`. |
| Cursor      | Install [Cursor CLI](https://cursor.com/cli), then run `agent login`.                        |
| Grok Build  | Install [Grok Build CLI](https://x.ai/cli), then run `grok login`.                           |
| OpenCode    | Install [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai), then run `opencode auth login`.                     |
| Antigravity | Install and sign in with Google from T3 Code's provider settings.                            |

Provider CLIs must be on the server's `PATH`. If T3 Code cannot find one, set its
**Binary path** in provider settings, especially when using a version manager.
Cursor's executable is `cursor-agent`, although its login command is
`agent login`. Antigravity can use its managed runtime without a `PATH` entry.

When a provider CLI is behind its latest release, its provider card shows the
available version. **Update now** appears only when T3 Code can tell which
installer owns the CLI (its own update command, Homebrew, or a global npm, pnpm,
bun, or Vite+ install) and runs that installer. Otherwise update the CLI the same
way you installed it. Homebrew installs compare against the version Homebrew
offers, which can trail the npm release by a few hours.

Add another provider instance for a separate account or configuration. Each
instance can have its own environment variables, such as API keys or a custom
base URL. Mark secret values as sensitive; after saving, T3 Code does not display
their original values.

For Codex and Claude, set **HTTP proxy URL** on the provider instance to forward
CLI requests, including token refresh, through an HTTP or HTTPS forward proxy.
Use an endpoint such as `http://proxy.example.com:3128`, without a path or embedded
credentials. The proxy must be reachable from the environment running the CLI.
This setting takes precedence over proxy environment variables and keeps localhost
connections local. Clear it to restore the environment's network settings.
Browser sign-in pages still use your browser's own connection.

For provider-specific setup and accounts, see [Codex](./providers-codex.md),
[Claude](./providers-claude.md), [OpenCode](./providers-opencode.md), and
[Antigravity](./providers-antigravity.md).

### Transfer providers to another machine

In the web or desktop app, open **Settings → Providers**, select the source
environment, and choose **Export**. On the destination environment, choose
**Import** and select the downloaded file. Imports add new instances and keep
existing providers. Install the provider CLIs on the destination first.

The file includes all saved provider configurations, proxy settings, and environment
secrets, including Claude tokens saved through T3 sign-in. Codex `auth.json` and
Claude `.credentials.json` logins are included when available. Check the export's
warnings for keychain-only and other external logins that need signing in again.
Shell environment variables and external CLI configuration files are not copied.

Codex and Claude receive new credential directories, preserving account pools.
Review other machine-specific paths and ensure the destination can reach your
proxy. The export contains **unencrypted credentials**; transfer it privately and
delete it when finished.
